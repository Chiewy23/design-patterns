# Popular Design Patterns

Design Patterns are known solutions to common problems.

There are hundreds of design patterns available, so this repo only covers some of the most common ones:

## Singleton

Ensures only one instance of a class is created.

## Factory

Have a dedicated place in which to create objects.

The first rule of design patterns is always program to an interface (or at least, a base class).

## Template Method

Subclasses decide how to implement steps in an algorithm.

## Adapter

Converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.

Adapter lets classes work together which couldn't otherwise due to incompatible interfaces.

## Facade

Simplifies the interface of a set of classes. It makes a software library easy to use.

## Strategy

Enables an algorithm's behaviour to be selected at runtime.
